# üîß OAuth Scope Fix Documentation

## **Issue Encountered:**
- Could only see 3 folders instead of expected 26
- Could not find AAdvantage files despite user seeing 11 statements
- Search queries returned 0 results
- Limited access to file content

## **Root Cause Analysis:**
The original OAuth scope configuration was overly complex and potentially conflicting:
- Multiple scopes (`drive`, `drive.file`, `drive.readonly`) were conflicting
- The `drive.file` scope is more restrictive than `drive` and can limit search capabilities
- The `drive.readonly` scope was redundant with `drive`

## **Solution Applied:**

### **File Modified:** `main.py`
**Location:** Lines 89-93

**Before (Complex Scopes):**
```python
# Google Drive API scopes
SCOPES = [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly'
]
```

**After (Simplified Scope):**
```python
# Google Drive API scopes
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']
```

## **What Each Scope Provides:**
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` - **FULL ACCESS** to all files and folders in Google Drive
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` - **RESTRICTED ACCESS** to only files opened with the app
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` - **READ-ONLY ACCESS** (redundant with `drive`)

## **Why the Fix Works:**
1. **Eliminates Scope Conflicts** - Single scope prevents permission conflicts
2. **Full Access** - `drive` scope provides complete access to search and read all files
3. **Simplified Permissions** - Cleaner OAuth flow with single permission request
4. **Search Capability** - Full scope enables comprehensive file search functionality

## **Implementation Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ **Simplified OAuth scopes** in `main.py`
2. ‚úÖ **Deleted existing token.json** to force re-authentication
3. ‚úÖ **Re-authenticated** with new simplified scope
4. ‚úÖ **Tested search functionality** (search now works, though AAdvantage files still not found - this suggests a different issue)

## **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Authentication working** with simplified scope
- ‚úÖ **Search API functional** (no more permission errors)
- ‚úÖ **File access working** (can access files by ID)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **AAdvantage files still not found** - This suggests the issue might be:
  - Files are in a different location than expected
  - Search query syntax needs adjustment
  - Files might be in shared drives or have different permissions

## **Next Steps Required:**
1. **Investigate AAdvantage file locations** - Check if they're in shared drives or different folders
2. **Test different search queries** - Try broader search terms
3. **Verify file permissions** - Ensure files are accessible to the authenticated account
4. **Check folder structure** - Use the backup data to understand actual file locations

## **Date Applied:** August 11, 2025
## **Context:** Fixing Google Drive API search and access issues for statement organization

---

**Note:** The simplified `drive` scope gives the application the same level of access to Google Drive that the user has through the web interface, which should resolve the search and access limitations we were experiencing.
